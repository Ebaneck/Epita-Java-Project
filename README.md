Running the application:

We have enhanced the running of the application by adding a launchable bat file for windows users. This file in present in the root
directory, but users need to edit it with appropriate information before executing it.

Our goal is to make the execution of this application seamless and effortless. FOr this reason, We think it will be wise to package our code with a apache derby entirely
